<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
    Childish Gambino, known as Donald McKinnely Glover, is a rapper from East Atlanta,GA in a subcity called Stone Mountain. He has many talents, and rapping is one of his less known talents. He is also known as a writer for famous tv show "30 rock" and creator of tv show "Atlanta". He has been primary actor in quite a few films as well. He has 4 albums including Camp, Because The Internet, Awaken My Love, and his EP Kauai. Then he also has 2 mixtapes, STN Mountain and Royalty. I have liked his mixtapes better than any of his albums to be honest. Overall this guys is pretty darn talented.
